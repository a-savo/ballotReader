\usage{
read_vertical_results(file, range, colnames)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A URL or path to a .pdf file.}

\item{colnames}{A character vector containing the names for each column.}

\description{
Reads election results from .pdf files where column titles are formatted vertically.
}
\details{
Vertically formatted text is often formatted incorrectly when converting
.pdf files to tabular data formats such as data.frames and tibbles. This
function includes additional parameters to help generate well-formatted
data.frames for a single race from .pdfs containing election results with
vertical column headers.
